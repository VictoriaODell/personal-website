Hey, I'm Victoria. I'm a graphic designer in Austin, Texas. I have interest and experience in UX/UI, interactive design, and branding.
<br><br>
Curretly, I work at Continuum Analytics.
I strive to make spaces diverse, inclusive, and empowering.
Through good design and advocacy I hope to facilitate positive and progressive change.
When I'm not creating you can find me on Slack or at an Instameet.
