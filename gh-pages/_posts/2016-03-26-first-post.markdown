Hey! Thanks for stopping by. I'm currently working on updating my
website. I am working with Jekyll to build a blog into my site and update the look and feel to
better reflect how I feel about myself 1 year out of college.
<br><br>
In the process I would like to get a better handle on sass and using Github/Git.
I'm kind of a noob so it might take a bit to get everything up and running in a way that satisfies me.
But, I'm excited about trying something new and being able to add and subtract as I see fit. Any practice
using HTML more effectively and managing CSS and sass is good practice for me.
<br><br>
**Why Jekyll?** I was exposed to Jekyll when I started helping with the Open Austin website. I like that it doesn't require
me to learn PHP or lots of javascript. It also gives me a solid frame with the ability to manipulate elements
in way that makes me feel more in control of my site.
<br><br>
Expect some more post from me very soon and check back on my site as I tweak and adjust it.
<br><br>
Also, [check out Jekyll for yourself](https://jekyllrb.com/) and let me know if you have any tips or tricks for better managing a Jekyll site.
