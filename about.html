Hey, I'm Victoria. I'm a designer in Austin, Texas. I have interest and experience in UX/UI, branding, and community building.
I'm originally from Mesquite, Texas and graduated from Texas State in 2015 with a B.F.A in Communication Design.
<br><br>
Currently, I work at <a target="_blank" href="http://continuum.io">Continuum Analytics</a>, a big data analytics startup. I also volunteer with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open-austin.org">Open Austin</a>, an all volunteer Civic Tech group.
I aim to make spaces diverse, inclusive, and empowering.
Through design and advocacy I hope to facilitate positive change and collaboration.
When I'm not creating you can find me on the <a href="http://slack.open-austin.org/">Open Austin Slack</a>, riding the 7, or <a href="https://github.com/VictoriaODell">trying to code</a>.
