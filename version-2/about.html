Hey, I'm Victoria. I'm a designer in Austin, Texas. I have interest and experience in UX/UI, branding, and community building.
I'm orignially from Mesquite, Texas and graduated from Texas State in 2015 with a B.F.A in Communication Design.
<br><br>
Currently, I work at Continuum Analytics, a big data analytics startup. I also volunteer with Open Austin, an all volunteer Civic Tech group.
I aim to make spaces diverse, inclusive, and empowering.
Through design and advocacy I hope to facilitate positive change and collaboration.
